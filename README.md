### Project Description
AURA is a comprehensive application designed to analyze and visualize the emotional and mental state of users based on their textual input. The application detects emotions, analyzes sentiment, and generates personalized advice to help users manage their stress levels.

### The Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, individuals are increasingly experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety due to various personal and professional challenges. Despite the availability of numerous mental health resources, many people struggle to find personalized and immediate support that addresses their unique emotional states. Traditional methods of stress management often fail to provide real-time, tailored advice that can help individuals cope with their specific situations.


### The Solution
The solution is to develop a web application that can accurately analyze a person's emotional and mental state based on their textual input and provide personalized, actionable advice to help them manage their stress levels effectively. This solution leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect emotions, analyze sentiment, and generate contextually relevant advice, thereby offering a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for mental health support.
